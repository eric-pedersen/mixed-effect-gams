#I: Introduction

Two of the most popular and powerful modelling techniques currently in use by ecologists are generalized additive models [GAMs; @wood_generalized_2017] for modelling flexible regression functions, and generalized linear mixed models ["hierarchical generalized linear models" (HGLMs) or simply "hierarchical models"; @Bolker:2009cs; @gelman2013bayesian] for modelling between-group variability in regression relationships.

At first glance, GAMs and HGLMs are very different tools used to solve different problems. GAMs are used to estimate smooth functional relationships between predictor variables and the response. Examples of such relationships would be the swimming speed of snakes as function of temperature [@vickers_using_2017], or populations fluctuating over time [@simpson_modelling_2018].  HGLMs, on the other hand, are used to estimate linear relationships between predictor variables and response, but impose a structure where predictors are organized into groups (often referred to as "blocks") and the relationships between predictor and response may differ between those groups. Either the slope or intercept, or both, may be subject to grouping. A typical example of HGLM use might be to include site-specific effects in a model of fish growth rates [@pedersen_long-term_2017], or to model individual level heterogeneity in movement behaviour with repeated observations of multiple individuals [@jonsen_joint_2016].

However, the connection between HGLMs and GAMs is quite deep, both conceptually and mathematically  [@verbyla_analysis_2002]. HGLMs and GAMs fit highly variable models by "pooling" parameter estimates towards one another. In an HGLM, this occurs as group-level effects are pulled towards global effects. In a GAM, this occurs in the enforcement of a smoothness criterion on the variability of a functional relationship, pulling parameters towards a straight line.

Given this connection, a natural extension to the standard GAM framework is to allow smooth functional relationships between predictor and response to vary between groups, but in such a way that the different functions are in some sense pooled toward a common shape. We often want to know both how functional relationships vary between groups, and if a relationship holds across groups. We will refer to this type of model as a *hierarchical GAM*, or HGAM.  

There are many potential uses for HGAMs. For example, we can use HGAMs to estimate how the  maximum size of different fish species varies along a common temperature gradient (figure  \ref{fig:fish_size}). Each species will typically have its own response function, but since the species overlap in range, they should have similar responses over at least some of the temperature gradient; figure \ref{fig:fish_size} shows all three species reach their largest maximum sizes in the centre of the temperature gradient. Estimating a separate function for each species throws away a lot of shared information and could result in highly noisy function estimates if there were only a few data points for each species. Estimating a single average relationship could result in a smooth that did not predict any specific group well. In our example, using a single global temperature-size relationship would miss that the three species have distinct temperature optima, and that the orange species is significantly smaller at all temperatures than the other two (figure \ref{fig:fish_size}). We prefer a hierarchical model that includes a global temperature-size curve plus species-specific curves that were penalized to be close to the mean function.

This paper discusses several approaches to group-level smoothing, and corresponding trade-offs.  We focus on fitting HGAMs with popular the **mgcv** package for the R statistical programming language,  which allows for a variety of HGAM model structures and fitting strategies. We discuss options available to the modeller and practical and theoretical reasons for choosing them.  We demonstrate the different approaches across a range of case studies.

This paper is divided into five sections. Part II is a brief review of how GAMs work and their relation to hierarchical models. In part III, we discuss different HGAM formulations, what assumptions each model makes about how information is shared between groups, and different ways of specifying these models in **mgcv**. In part IV, we work through example analyses using this approach, to demonstrate the modelling process and how HGAMs can be incorporated into the ecologist's quantitative toolbox. Finally, in part IV, we discuss some of the computational and statistical issues involved in fitting HGAMs in **mgcv**. We have also included all the code needed to make the figures for this document in supplemental code (online), and on the GitHub repository associated with this paper [github.com/noamross/mixed-effects-gams](http://www.github.com/noamross/mixed-effect-gams).
